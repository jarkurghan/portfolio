                            Back in 2012, I decided to try my hand at creating custom Tumblr themes and tumbled head first into the rabbit hole of coding and
                            web development. Fast-forward to today, and I’ve had the privilege of building software for an advertising agency, a start-up, a
                            huge corporation, and a digital product studio. My main focus these days is building accessible user interfaces for our customers at
                            Klaviyo. I most enjoy building software in the sweet spot where design and engineering meet — things that look good but are also
                            built well under the hood. In my free time, I've also released an online video course that covers everything you need to know to
                            build a web app with the Spotify API. When I’m not at the computer, I’m usually rock climbing, reading, hanging out with my wife and
                            two cats, or running around Hyrule searching for Korok seeds Korok seeds.
